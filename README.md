# hello-world

Hi Github,

Do any other non-techies feel like joining GitHub is akin to swallowing the red pill?

Why I am here? I'm the cofounder of a very early stage tech platform called @woqen and I want to challenge our assumptions on how organisations are tackling diversity issues. I set out to inform, not offend - and happy to receive constructive feedback.

I'm also going to attempt to learn some basic programming over the coming years.

Sl√°inte, Dan
